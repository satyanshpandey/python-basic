# Convert Decimal to binary
# in this case we will be use  bin()  function for decimal to binary converction
a = 100
vi = bin(a)
print("Decimal to binary",vi)

# int function is use for decimal to binary conversion
    # the int function takes as second argument the base of the number to be converted which is 2 in case of binary
# numbers
# Forbinary Decimal to binary conversin
print(int(vi,2))



# Octal conversion :-
#     in python you can use the oct() function to convert from a decimal value to it's octal value
o = 79
# Base 8 (octal)
oct_a = oct(o)
print("Octal",oct_a)
# you can also use the int() function along with the correct base which is 8 for the octal number system
print(int(oct_a , 8))



# Type conversion to hexadecimal
# hexadecimal is base 16 number system.
# Hexadecimal has six additional symbols that is used beyond the number found in the decimal number system
# Ex:-  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E and F

# in python you can use the hex() , function to convert from a decimal value to it's corresponding hexadecimal value.
a = 79
# Base 16(hexadecimal)
hex_a = hex(a)
print("Hexadecimal",hex_a)
# the int function with base 16 for the hexadecimal number system
print(int(hex_a,16))
